0,Precision Medicine Approaches with Metabolomics and Artificial Intelligence,"Recent technological innovations in the field of mass spectrometry have supported the use of metabolomics analysis for precision medicine. This growth has been allowed also by the application of algorithms to data analysis, including multivariate and machine learning methods, which are fundamental to managing large number of variables and samples. In the present review, we reported and discussed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for metabolomics data analysis. Particularly, we focused on widely used non-linear machine learning classifiers, such as ANN, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. A discussion of recent studies and research focused on disease classification, biomarker identification and early diagnosis is presented. Challenges in the implementation of metabolomics-AI systems, limitations thereof and recent tools were also discussed.","['1 Department of Translational Medicine, University of Piemonte Orientale, 28100 Novara, Italy.', '2 Center for Translational Research on Autoimmune and Allergic Diseases, University of Piemonte Orientale, 28100 Novara, Italy.', '3 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Piemonte Orientale, 28100 Novara, Italy.', '4 Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, IRCCS, 20089 Rozzano, Italy.', '5 Metabolic Signaling Group, Curtin Medical School, Curtin University, Perth 6845, Australia.', '6 Department of Sciences and Technological Innovation, University of Piemonte Orientale, 15100 Alessandria, Italy.', '7 NovaMechanics Ltd., Digeni Akrita 51, Nicosia 1070, Cyprus.']","Elettra Barberis, Shahzaib Khoso, Antonio Sica, Marco Falasca, Alessandra Gennari, Francesco Dondero, Antreas Afantitis, Marcello Manfredi, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,artificial intelligence; biomarkers; machine learning; metabolomics; precision medicine.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36232571
1,Advancing Biosensors with Machine Learning,"Chemometrics play a critical role in biosensors-based detection, analysis, and diagnosis. Nowadays, as a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) have achieved impressive advances. However, novel advanced ML methods, especially deep learning, which is famous for image analysis, facial recognition, and speech recognition, has remained relatively elusive to the biosensor community. Herein, how ML can be beneficial to biosensors is systematically discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of most popular ML algorithms are summarized on the basis of sensing data analysis. Specially, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are emphasized. Diverse ML-assisted electrochemical biosensors, wearable electronics, SERS and other spectra-based biosensors, fluorescence biosensors and colorimetric biosensors are comprehensively discussed. Furthermore, biosensor networks and multibiosensor data fusion are introduced. This review will nicely bridge ML with biosensors, and greatly expand chemometrics for detection, analysis, and diagnosis.","['1 Department of Chemical Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 100 Institute Road, Worcester, Massachusetts 01609, United States.', '2 Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts 01609, United States.', '3 Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269, United States.']","Feiyun Cui, Yun Yue, Yi Zhang, Ziming Zhang, H Susan Zhou, ",ACS sensors,2020,CNN; SERS; artificial intelligence (AI); chemometrics; deep learning; intelligent biosensor; machine learning (ML); multidimensional features; sensing data; wearable electronics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33185417

7,The use of machine learning in rare diseases: a scoping review,"Background:
        
      
      Emerging machine learning technologies are beginning to transform medicine and healthcare and could also improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. Currently, there are no systematic reviews that investigate, from a general perspective, how machine learning is used in a rare disease context. This scoping review aims to address this gap and explores the use of machine learning in rare diseases, investigating, for example, in which rare diseases machine learning is applied, which types of algorithms and input data are used or which medical applications (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis or treatment) are studied. Methods:
        
      
      Using a complex search string including generic search terms and 381 individual disease names, studies from the past 10 years (2010-2019) that applied machine learning in a rare disease context were identified on PubMed. To systematically map the research activity, eligible studies were categorized along different dimensions (e.g., rare disease group, type of algorithm, input data), and the number of studies within these categories was analyzed. Results:
        
      
      Two hundred eleven studies from 32 countries investigating 74 different rare diseases were identified. Diseases with a higher prevalence appeared more often in the studies than diseases with a lower prevalence. Moreover, some rare disease groups were investigated more frequently than to be expected (e.g., rare neurologic diseases and rare systemic or rheumatologic diseases), others less frequently (e.g., rare inborn errors of metabolism and rare skin diseases). Ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) were the algorithms most commonly applied in the studies. Only a small proportion of studies evaluated their algorithms on an external data set (11.8%) or against a human expert (2.4%). As input data, images (32.2%), demographic data (27.0%) and ""omics"" data (26.5%) were used most frequently. Most studies used machine learning for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%) whereas studies aiming to improve treatment were relatively scarce (4.7%). Patient numbers in the studies were small, typically ranging from 20 to 99 (35.5%). Conclusion:
        
      
      Our review provides an overview of the use of machine learning in rare diseases. Mapping the current research activity, it can guide future work and help to facilitate the successful application of machine learning in rare diseases.","['1 Technische Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '2 Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.', '3 Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany. moritz.lehne@bihealth.de.', '4 Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', '5 Hochschule Niederrhein - University of Applied Sciences, Krefeld, Germany.']","Julia Schaefer, Moritz Lehne, Josef Schepers, Fabian Prasser, Sylvia Thun, ",Orphanet journal of rare diseases,2020,Machine learning; Rare diseases; Scoping review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32517778

10,Application of Machine Learning in Rheumatic Immune Diseases,"People are paying greater attention to their personal health as society develops and progresses, and rheumatic immunological disorders have become a serious concern that affects human health. As a result, research on a stable, trustworthy, and effective auxiliary diagnostic method for rheumatic immune disorders is critical. Machine learning overcomes the inefficiencies and volatility of human data processing, ushering in a revolution in artificial intelligence research. With the use of big data, machine learning-based application research on rheumatic immunological disorders has already demonstrated detection abilities that are on par with or better than those of medical professionals. Artificial intelligence systems are now being applied in the field of rheumatic immune disorders, with an emphasis on the identification of patient joint images. This article focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms in the diagnosis of rheumatic illnesses, as well as the practical implications of disease-assisted diagnosis systems and intelligent medical diagnosis. This article focuses on three common machine learning algorithms for research and debate: logistic regression, support vector machines, and adaptive boosting techniques. The three algorithms are used to build diagnostic models based on rheumatic illness data, and the performance of each model is assessed. According to a thorough analysis of the assessment data, the diagnostic model based on the limit gradient boosting method has the best resilience.

14,A survey on advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques assisting in renewable energy generation,"The sustainability of the earth depends on renewable energy. Forecasting the output of renewable energy has a big impact on how we operate and manage our power networks. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is crucial to ensuring grid dependability and permanence and reducing the risk and cost of the energy market and infrastructure. Although there are several approaches to forecasting solar radiation on a global scale, the two most common ones are machine learning algorithms and cloud pictures combined with physical models. The objective is to present a summary of machine learning-based techniques for solar irradiation forecasting in this context. Renewable energy is being used more and more in the world's energy grid. Numerous strategies, including hybrids, physical models, statistical approaches, and artificial intelligence techniques, have been developed to anticipate the use of renewable energy. This paper examines methods for forecasting renewable energy based on deep learning and machine learning. Review and analysis of deep learning and machine learning forecasts for renewable energy come first. The second paragraph describes metaheuristic optimization techniques for renewable energy.

15,Supervised machine learning tools: a tutorial for clinicians,"In an increasingly data-driven world, artificial intelligence is expected to be a key tool for converting big data into tangible benefits and the healthcare domain is no exception to this. Machine learning aims to identify complex patterns in multi-dimensional data and use these uncovered patterns to classify new unseen cases or make data-driven predictions. In recent years, deep neural networks have shown to be capable of producing results that considerably exceed those of conventional machine learning methods for various classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we provide an accessible tutorial of the most important supervised machine learning concepts and methods, including deep learning, which are potentially the most relevant for the medical domain.

Here, we review how researchers have used several promising machine learning approaches to make phylogenetic inferences. Despite the promise of these methods, several barriers prevent supervised machine learning from reaching its full potential in phylogenetics. We discuss these barriers and potential paths forward.

However, even the most advanced machine learning techniques require relatively large, labeled EEG repositories. EEG data collection and labeling are costly. Moreover, combining available datasets to achieve a large data volume is usually infeasible due to inconsistent experimental paradigms across trials. Self-supervised learning (SSL) solves these challenges because it enables learning from EEG records across trials with variable experimental paradigms, even when the trials explore different phenomena. It aggregates multiple EEG repositories to increase accuracy, reduce bias, and mitigate overfitting in machine learning training. In addition, SSL could be employed in situations where there is limited labeled training data, and manual labeling is costly. This article: 1) provides a brief introduction to SSL; 2) describes some SSL techniques employed in recent studies, including EEG; 3) proposes current and potential SSL techniques for future investigations in EEG studies; 4) discusses the cons and pros of different SSL techniques; and 5) proposes holistic implementation tips and potential future directions for EEG SSL practices.",NO_AFFILIATIONS,"Mohammad H Rafiei, Lynne V Gauthier, Hojjat Adeli, Daniel Takabi, ",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35867362
20,Multi-Label Active Learning-Based Machine Learning Model for Heart Disease Prediction,"The rapid growth and adaptation of medical information to identify significant health trends and help with timely preventive care have been recent hallmarks of the modern healthcare data system. Heart disease is the deadliest condition in the developed world. Cardiovascular disease and its complications, including dementia, can be averted with early detection. Further research in this area is needed to prevent strokes and heart attacks. An optimal machine learning model can help achieve this goal with a wealth of healthcare data on heart disease. Heart disease can be predicted and diagnosed using machine-learning-based systems. Active learning (AL) methods improve classification quality by incorporating user-expert feedback with sparsely labelled data. In this paper, five (MMC, Random, Adaptive, QUIRE, and AUDI) selection strategies for multi-label active learning were applied and used for reducing labelling costs by iteratively selecting the most relevant data to query their labels. The selection methods with a label ranking classifier have hyperparameters optimized by a grid search to implement predictive modelling in each scenario for the heart disease dataset. Experimental evaluation includes accuracy and F-score with/without hyperparameter optimization. Results show that the generalization of the learning model beyond the existing data for the optimized label ranking model uses the selection method versus others due to accuracy. However, the selection method was highlighted in regards to the F-score using optimized settings.","['1 Faculty of Computers and Information Sciences, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.', '2 Faculty of Computer Science, New Mansoura University, Gamasa 35712, Egypt.', '3 Department of Computer Science, University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia.', '4 Faculty of Engineering, Delta University for Science and Technology, Gamasa 35712, Egypt.']","Ibrahim M El-Hasnony, Omar M Elzeki, Ali Alshehri, Hanaa Salem, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,active learning; chronic diseases; data mining; heart disease; machine learning; multi-label classification.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35161928
21,Machine fault detection methods based on machine learning algorithms: A review,"Preventive identification of mechanical parts failures has always played a crucial role in machine maintenance. Over time, as the processing cycles are repeated, the machinery in the production system is subject to wear with a consequent loss of technical efficiency compared to optimal conditions. These conditions can, in some cases, lead to the breakage of the elements with consequent stoppage of the production process pending the replacement of the element. This situation entails a large loss of turnover on the part of the company. For this reason, it is crucial to be able to predict failures in advance to try to replace the element before its wear can cause a reduction in machine performance. Several systems have recently been developed for the preventive faults detection that use a combination of low-cost sensors and algorithms based on machine learning. In this work the different methodologies for the identification of the most common mechanical failures are examined and the most widely applied algorithms based on machine learning are analyzed: Support Vector Machine (SVM) solutions, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) applications, and Deep Generative Systems. These topics have been described in detail and the works most appreciated by the scientific community have been reviewed to highlight the strengths in identifying faults and to outline the directions for future challenges.","['1 Department of Architecture and Industrial Design, Università degli Studi della Campania LuigiVanvitelli, Borgo San Lorenzo - 81031 Aversa (Ce), Italy.']","Giuseppe Ciaburro, ",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022,classification; deep learning; machine fault diagnosis; machine learning; regression; review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36124599

34,An Overview of Machine Learning within Embedded and Mobile Devices-Optimizations and Applications,"Embedded systems technology is undergoing a phase of transformation owing to the novel advancements in computer architecture and the breakthroughs in machine learning applications. The areas of applications of embedded machine learning (EML) include accurate computer vision schemes, reliable speech recognition, innovative healthcare, robotics, and more. However, there exists a critical drawback in the efficient implementation of ML algorithms targeting embedded applications. Machine learning algorithms are generally computationally and memory intensive, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments such as embedded and mobile devices. In order to efficiently implement these compute and memory-intensive algorithms within the embedded and mobile computing space, innovative optimization techniques are required at the algorithm and hardware levels. To this end, this survey aims at exploring current research trends within this circumference. First, we present a brief overview of compute intensive machine learning algorithms such as hidden Markov models (HMM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs), support vector machines (SVMs), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). Furthermore, we consider different optimization techniques currently adopted to squeeze these computational and memory-intensive algorithms within resource-limited embedded and mobile environments. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of these algorithms in microcontroller units, mobile devices, and hardware accelerators. Conclusively, we give a comprehensive overview of key application areas of EML technology, point out key research directions and highlight key take-away lessons for future research exploration in the embedded machine learning domain.","['1 Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos, Akoka 100213, Lagos State, Nigeria.', '2 Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Institute of Digital Communication, Ruhr University, 44801 Bochum, Germany.', '3 Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Covenant University, Ota 112233, Ogun State, Nigeria.']","Taiwo Samuel Ajani, Agbotiname Lucky Imoize, Aderemi A Atayero, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,TinyML; computer architecture; deep learning; embedded computing systems; machine learning; mobile computing; mobile devices; optimization techniques.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34203119

36,Machine Learning for Biomedical Time Series Classification: From Shapelets to Deep Learning,"With the biomedical field generating large quantities of time series data, there has been a growing interest in developing and refining machine learning methods that allow its mining and exploitation. Classification is one of the most important and challenging machine learning tasks related to time series. Many biomedical phenomena, such as the brain's activity or blood pressure, change over time. The objective of this chapter is to provide a gentle introduction to time series classification. In the first part we describe the characteristics of time series data and challenges in its analysis. The second part provides an overview of common machine learning methods used for time series classification. A real-world use case, the early recognition of sepsis, demonstrates the applicability of the methods discussed.","['1 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland.', '2 SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', '3 Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zurich, Basel, Switzerland. karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch.', '4 SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland. karsten.borgwardt@bsse.ethz.ch.']","Christian Bock, Michael Moor, Catherine R Jutzeler, Karsten Borgwardt, ","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",NO_DATE,Classification; Deep learning; Onset detection; Subsequence mining; Time series.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32804360
37,Machine learning-based modeling to predict inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase,"Acetylcholinesterase enzyme is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine and is an important drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. When this enzyme is inhibited, more acetylcholine is available in the synaptic cleft for the use, which leads to enhanced memory and cognitive ability. The aim of the present work is to create machine learning models for distinguishing between AChE inhibitors and non-inhibitors using algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and random forest (RF). The developed models were evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation and external dataset. Descriptor analysis was performed to identify most important features for the activity of molecules. Descriptors which were identified as important include maxssCH2, minHssNH, SaasC, minssCH2, bit 128 MACCS key, bit 104 MACCS key, bit 24 estate fingerprint and bit 18 estate fingerprints. The model developed using fingerprints based on random forest algorithm produced better results compared to other models. The overall accuracy of best model on test set was 85.38 percent.

69,Machine Learning Techniques for Arousal Classification from Electrodermal Activity: A Systematic Review,"This article introduces a systematic review on arousal classification based on electrodermal activity (EDA) and machine learning (ML). From a first set of 284 articles searched for in six scientific databases, fifty-nine were finally selected according to various criteria established. The systematic review has made it possible to analyse all the steps to which the EDA signals are subjected: acquisition, pre-processing, processing and feature extraction. Finally, all ML techniques applied to the features of these signals for arousal classification have been studied. It has been found that support vector machines and artificial neural networks stand out within the supervised learning methods given their high-performance values. In contrast, it has been shown that unsupervised learning is not present in the detection of arousal through EDA. This systematic review concludes that the use of EDA for the detection of arousal is widely spread, with particularly good results in classification with the ML methods found.","['1 Departamento de Sistemas Informáticos, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, 02071 Albacete, Spain.', '2 Neurocognition and Emotion Unit, Instituto de Investigación en Informática, 02071 Albacete, Spain.', '3 CIBERSAM-ISCIII (Biomedical Research Networking Center in Mental Health, Instituto de Salud Carlos III), 28016 Madrid, Spain.']","Roberto Sánchez-Reolid, Francisco López de la Rosa, Daniel Sánchez-Reolid, María T López, Antonio Fernández-Caballero, ","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,arousal; electrodermal activity; machine learning; systematic review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36433482
